            <br>
            <p>Please read this Mobile Application End User License Agreement (“EULA”) carefully before downloading or
                using the Smartsheet Inc. (“Smartsheet”) mobile application (“Youtube Bookmark Manager”), which allows
                You to
                access Smartsheet’s internet-delivered service (“Subscription Service”) from Your mobile device. This
                EULA forms a binding legal agreement between you (and any other entity on whose behalf you accept these
                terms) (collectively “You” or “Your”) and Smartsheet (each separately a “Party” and collectively the
                “Parties”) as of the date you download the Mobile App. Your use of the Mobile App is subject to this
                EULA and Your use of the Subscription Service will remain subject to the existing agreement governing
                such use (the “Subscription Agreement”). With respect to the use of the Mobile App, and to the extent
                the Subscription Agreement conflicts with this EULA, the terms of this EULA will govern and control
                solely with respect to use of the Mobile App. </p>

                App. Notwithstanding the foregoing, You are responsible for complying with the updated terms posted
                online at Smartsheet’s website even if these updated terms appear online at Smartsheet’s website before
                being posted on the Mobile App. Your continued use of the Mobile App after Smartsheet publishes notice
                of changes to this EULA indicates Your consent to the updated terms.</p>
